#### Runtime Complexity

- constant time [1]: No matter how many elements we are working with, the algorithm will always take same time.
- log time [log(n)] : 
- Linear Time [n] :
- Quasilinear Time [n * log(n)] : 
- Quadratic Time [n ^ 2]: Every element in collection has to be compared to every other element.(the Handshake Problem)
- Exponential Time [2 ^ n]: if you add a single element to collection,the processing power required doubles.  



 -two loops on different collection : O(n+m)
 - two loop on different collection but nested : O(n * m)
 - Sorting : O(n * log(n))
 - searching  : O(log(n))
